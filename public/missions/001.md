# Mission // #001
## Bug-Hunt

The situation around the colony has steadily deteriorated, and the militia can no longer keep things under control. Things are about to get bad, and Patience has requested your assistance in preventing that.

# Goals
- Stabilize the situation around Evergreen. Track the raiders, try to figure out who they are, and stop the attacks.

# Stakes
- Evergreen will be forced to pull back and defend its own walls, losing contact with its outlying farms in the process and leaving them at the mercy of the raiders.

# Reserves
- None at this time.
