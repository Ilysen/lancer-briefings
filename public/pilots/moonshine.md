Jackie, by all accounts, is a criminal. They prefer the term outlaw.

Jackie has spent about 10 subjective years roaming the stars, looking for new adventures, and new things to "tango" with. Jackie's definition of tango is loose, ranging from blowing up buildings, to scuffles, to a game of poker. Although Jackie never sticks around as long as she promises. After a certain amount of time in one place, Jackie disappears without a word to anyone there. They've left a lot of good people behind, but of course, that's not her problem, now is it? Jackie is by all accounts friendly, if not a little rowdy. They always have a story to share if you pass them a drink. Don't ask them what happened on ACE-4 Blue, it's not what they said it was in the paper. Jackie considers themself constantly bulking, and is almost always seen munching on some high protein snack, always offering to share.

Jackie stands at an even 6'3" with a wide, muscular frame, mismatched green and blue eyes, and a devil's grin, lengthened by a scar running from the left edge of their lip, up their cheek. Their body is covered in freckles. Her slicked back mullet has a completely foolish look, but it works for them. They're always running around in a tank top, camo  cargo pants, and black combat boots. No matter the occasion, no matter the weather. Frequently has bandages around her gloves for padding when wearing Rodeo Boots.
