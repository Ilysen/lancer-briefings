It started with a Beetle, they say. From the moment they could walk, Boa's hands were in the dirt, searching for every little critter that scared away others on the playground - but not them. They were fascinated by each little discovery they found - the first being a rather plain beetle. Of course, it was nothing spectacular, but they were infatuated with the way that they moved. Then, they saw the way that it interacted with the world around it. Soon they were identifying plants and every little thing they could find, writing down how they fitted into their home in a little notebook. This fascination carried them into their adult life, where they quickly gained two Doctorate's in Ecology, one for a theory on pheremone based communication of a species of Mantodea-adjacent insects on their home planet, and how an emitter could be used to induce a natural pest elimination, and discovering a programmable mycelium to encourage biodiversity and targeted growth. They gained the attention of Union, and became a researcher on a Union space station known as Tir Na Nog, a haven for a variety of ecologists and biologists. After several years there, Boa grew tired of the simulated environments, perfectly tuned to their testing environments. They wanted to see the vast array of complicated, messy ecosystems across the galaxy, and signed up to learn mech piloting to be qualified for hands-on, farfield research.
