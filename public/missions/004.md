# Mission // #004
## Rallying Cry

Dthall is brief and straightforward: she doesn't believe that Hivehome or Evergreen will survive alone. Now that she knows Evergreen isn't with the Machine, she's more convinced than ever that uniting the communities is the only possible way to survive.

# Goals
- Convince the city-states of the HUC to rally under one banner, come to the aid of Evergreen, and continue the war against the Machine.

# Stakes
- If the HUC and Evergreen stand divided, Dthall believes neither of them has a chance at surviving what's to come.

# Reserves
- **Southwest:** Recon Drone
