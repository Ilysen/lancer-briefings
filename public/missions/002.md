# Mission // #002
## Faithful Hound

# Goals
- Bypass or neutralize the automated defenses of SecComm Security Complex E-03.
- Locate the data center and retrieve any surviving security logs.
- Appropriate usable supplies whenever possible.

# Stakes
- There are no defenses to speak of except an early-warning radar fence that's yet to be set up. If defense material cannot be recovered and repurposed, Rue will be helpless against attack.

# Reserves
- One mech-carried chemical explosive. It can be deployed as a Quick Action to melt through a single sealed door within the complex.
