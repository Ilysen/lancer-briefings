# Future Perfect
The Expedition conducted its third downtime over the course of about a month and a half, starting with the group introducing themselves at Cornucopia and registering themselves as guests there:
* Macross used the orbital platform to conduct a thorough sweep, and at last made visual confirmation of a camouflaged corvette - almost certainly belonging to the SSC - searching the Crucible Region.
* Tempest Bride tried to slip into Cornucopia discreetly, but was caught by the senior hydroponicist, who kindly directed her to the main entrance. Afterwards, she put the *Lotus Prince* to work in clearing a nest of giant wasps that had been terrorizing the colony's farm workers.
* Duck got in touch with an old company friend, who confirmed that his former employer didn't seem to be in the process of tracking him down. Later, he attempted to use *Ballbreaker* as a makeshift plow, with mixed success.

While in Cornucopia, a pilot presented themselves and requested work. After a brief interview, **Moonshine** was accepted into the expedition's ranks.

# Gold Rush
The group's fifth venture began with a simple goal: track down whatever remained of SecComm's research labs. They quickly received a legal threat from the Smith-Shimano Corpro demanding that they stop and surrender their assets, which they promptly ignored.

After some largely fruitless searching, the squad was confronted by an SSC team and its field commander - Desi Lamar - who reiterated the corpro's demand that the expedition give up its assets and cease its searching.

When the group refused to cave, Lamar ordered their troops to attack, and a brief scuffle ensued before being crashed by a patrol of Caspar Bugs. The Constellars retreated, but Desi made it clear that they'd be back.

# Come One, Come All

The Expedition continued its search by getting an up-to-date picture of the surface, using mapping drones shot from orbit. They didn't find anything, but they did clear a significant amount of territory.

On the way back, the group picked up a distress call from an SSC mech. They investigated, found a lightly-armed scout trapped under a rockfall and in need of assistance.

The group rescued the pilot from entrapment. His callsign was Sushi, and his frame was the *Incredible Strongman.* He explained that he had been ambushed by Caspar bugs, and to return the favor of his rescue, he misled his superiors about the party's location before scampering off (with their permission.)

# The Kind and Benevolent King

Winding down from searching in the next few days, August picked up a massive Caspar lifeform headed straight from the Expedition, seemingly with the goal of setting up a hive. The squad scrambled a response and met the bugs head-on, and the towering Caspar Viceroy was brought down just before it could reach the clearing.

In the coming days, it would become clear that this particular hive, no longer willing to suffer additional losses, had shifted its focus away from the Expedition, and begun new attacks on Cornucopia and the SSC expeditionaries instead.

# Keeping Tabs

The Expedition's next move was to learn more about behaviors of the Caspar bugs to get intel on the paths they frequent, and thus any artificial structures they might pass by. To do this, they manually marked and tagged worker drones in the jungle; Tandem modified the bugs to use built-in image recognition software to send a signal when they detected an artificial structure. After several days, they got a hit: a small depot in uncharted territory, evidently used in the past few decades.

En route to the depot, the squad's communications to August began to malfunction. They realized it was jamming just in time to avoid a lethal ambush, and a brief violent clash ensued between them and a Smith-Shimano Corpro kill squad. The opposing force was eventually brought down, although Desi Lamar - who was present with them - escaped again thanks to the timely and incredibly frustrating intervention of a technologically-advanced mech; the same one that was jamming the expedition's communications.

# Melody from the Past

The squad arrived at the depot, and found a surreal sight: buildings and machinery, arranged in a tiny compound, that had been maintained as early as forty years ago. Some brief searching uncovered more details on a terminal and a set of server racks:
* The depot was occupied between the years of 4969u and 4977u by a man named Randy, who left extensive logs of his time there.
* Randy was flabbergasted by the current state of Magus, and spent a great deal of his time researching the Caspar bugs and how they had come to pass.
* He referred to the bugs as "intrepid little test subjects", and had himself evidently woken from stasis some only recently before. He was fifty years old by the time of his final log.
* Randy was the owner of the Swallowtail whose wreckage was recovered so long ago, when the Expedition first touched down. He was using it as a reconnaisance and science mech before it was ambushed and destroyed by bugs.
* In his final log, he noted that he was planning to move to a new outpost by the coast, with coordinates attached. Those coordinates, unfortunately, were not useful for modern hardware or interpretation, meaning that finding the new outpost would require searching.

# Baptism by Fire

As the squad prepared to leave the depot, August followed up with an urgent communication: SSC's corvette had touched down for brief maintenance. There was a suite of sensitive equipment on the top, and he figured they had a good chance to getting on board and wrecking it before it could lift off again, tremendously setting them back.

The group hurried to the makeshift landing site and attacked the corvette by surprise, quickly overwhelming security forces and laying waste to the sensitive equipment they found. As the corvette suddenly lifted off and took to the skies, however, they realized they had much less time than August had thought.

A vicious battle ensued as the "science array" revealed itself to be not a suite of machinery at all - instead, it was a tremendous mech frame, a GUANDAO-class launch carrier, that had been serving as the SSC's mobile command center and bridge. With a little help from August, the squad was able to lay the carrier low, and as it fell, it let loose a concussive shockwave that blasted everything off of the carrier, plunging them into freefall.

For several gut-wrenching moments, the squad tumbled towards the ocean, evidently about to meet certain death. August arrived just in time to catch them from the fall, at which point he apologized with tremendous guilt for placing them in danger. His apology was allowed (if not accepted outright), and, finally, the *Burn Rubber* turned for home.
