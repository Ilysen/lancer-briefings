# Mission // #001
## Phosphorous Smoke
# Goals
- Bring the *Burn Rubber* and all of its supplies to Magus.
- Establish a FOB clear of insects.
- Keep August safe and alive.

# Stakes
- If the *Burn Rubber* goes down, you go down with it. Loss of the prefab kits means a return to base, which will take precious time.

# Reserves
- None at this time.
