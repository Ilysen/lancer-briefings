A brief introduction for Tandem Electra:

Their name, like their callsign, is as retro-retro futurist as it gets, harkening back to ancient and childish fantasies of some kind of 'space future.' Whether it's their actual name or just a (bad) attempt at ironic humor is hard to tell. 

Tandem is taller than average, due to their oversize prosthetic greaves, but doesn't cut a very imposing figure. They have dark brown hair, often dyed in temporary brights. Blue is a favorite. Out of combat, they dress well, in pseudo-uniform, or at the very least, a turtleneck and slacks. 

If you've met with Tandem, your first impression may have been that they are not cut out for this kind of work. They are easily impressed, kind-hearted, and possessed of a nearly infinite supply of robot fun facts. Typecast, they are the rookie that dies in the first half of the feature film. 

If you've spent any longer with them than that, you would have come to understand that their innocence belies a frightening sort of cunning. They are a crack-shot, and much less concerned with the dangers of violence than someone with their experience ought be. There is almost a degree of desensitization to the task at hand that makes one wonder what their background is.
