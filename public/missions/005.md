# Mission // #005
## California Gold Rush

# Goals
- Find what remains of the Second Committee's research mission on Magus.
- Stay ahead of Smith-Shimano.

# Stakes
- If we can't find anything now, we may never get a chance. SSC will gain the upper hand, and it's unlikely they'll use whatever they find there for a good cause.

# Reserves
- **Ballbreaker:** Boosted Servos (malfunctioning)
