# Mission // #002
## Vigilant Gaze

The raiders - whoever they are - have increased their activity close to the border. Whoever they are and whatever their goal is, they're preparing for something big.

Patience has elevated Evergreen to its maximum security level. Your task is to stay around the colony while Evergreen scouts try to predict the movements of the raiders, and respond to sightings and incidents as able. Fend off any potential attacks if at all possible, but prepare for the worst.

# Goals
- Defend Evergreen.

# Stakes
- If the raiders are able to strike at Evergreen's infrastructure, its defenses will be demolished and its ability to function will be crippled.

# Reserves
