# Arrival

**Seral-19** awoke in orbit around their destination: the continental world of **Hercynia**, bound for the colony of **Evergreen.** The carrier was staffed by a skeleton crew, with the vast remainder of its inhabitants remaining in stasis. After spending the time to wake up and get their bearings aboard the ship, their deployment arrived: time to go. A remote-controlled shuttle descended onto **Hercynia** with the members of **Seral-19**: **Prof**, **Southwest**, **Switchboard**, and the team's NHP, **Tzadek**.

# Ground Party

The squad arrived on the ourtskirts of the colony in a field - its landing bowl had been flooded by torrential rains, and was unusable at the time. They were met by **Brava Hadura** - the commander of **Evergreen's** militia - who instructed them to hurry: a sniper was in the area, and "the bugs" were good shots. The shuttle would subsequently bring down the squad's mechs, and then return to the carrier, which would shortly leave the planet's environs, only to return in a years' time or more.

**Brava** escorted the group through the colony's streets and alleys to the administrative heart: a walled compound called the **Governor's Farm.** She dispatched them to meet with the colony's administration, but then received last-minute notice that the meeting had been delayed til tomorrow morning. She apologized to the group, and brought them to the **Bottom of the Well**, a riverside venue and tavern that the administration had reserved rooms at to house the group for the duration of their stay.

# We Could Have Handled This By Text

After a night's rest and time to settle in, **Seral-19** was summoned to the **Governor's Farm** for a briefing on the colony's situation and details on their first assignment. There, they met **Patience** - the colony's municipal NHP - and **Edena Ji**, their attache. They warmly welcomed the squad to **Evergreen**, and gave them the following details:

* The colony had come under attack by unknown invaders, starting fourteen months ago. Homesteads and outlying farms have been attacked, with their food stores raided and the remainder burned to the ground.
* Rumors have spread among the militia that the attacks are being perpetrated by an aggressive native species of insect that used to live on the planet - "savage, consumptive, and with a startling ability to manipulate simple tools" - called the **Egregorians.** **Patience** counters this belief with evidence of the use of mechs and human corpses recovered from their wreckages. They believe that the raiders are pirates or claim-jumpers, intent on reaping the rich harvest of the land around **Evergreen.**
* **Evergreen's** resources have been stretched to the breaking point. The militia are terrified of being attacked by raiders, and things are getting bad. **Patience** gives the squad a choice of two tasks to undertake: help to escort **Chief Engineer Castor Fielding** and his engineers to the landing bowl to perform crucial repairs, or attempt to hunt down the sniper plaguing the town. The group opted for the former.

Before departing, **Prof** inquired about any potential backups or accessible knowledge about the planet's ecology and biosphere. In response, they were directed to the public omninet as well as **Dr. Eku Marricado**, a biologist who has been tasked with categorizing the local flora and fauna. She's been having a great deal of frustration with it due to holes in the data, and is hunting for photographs or documentation of new species. She, **Edena** said, might be willing to share more info from a professional eye.

# Bowl Season

**Seral-19** met up with **Castor** on the outskirts of the depot district, who greeted them heartily and gave a rundown of the basics: the landing bowl is about twenty kilometers out, and the gravel road there is flooded and cluttered with debris. His team had three all-terrain trucks that could make the trip, but they were anxious about the raiders and requested a security escort. The squad agreed to provide it, and together they set out for the bowl.

Two-thirds of the way to the landing bowl, the convoy was ambushed by raiders from all sides. They struck a decisive first blow, causing heavy damage and throwing the team into chaos, but the squad was able to punch a hole in the attackers and escort two of the trucks through by the skin of their teeth. The third would veer off into a clearing, and return to the convoy afterwards.

After the attack, **Castor** thanked the group profusely and set up the pump system required to drain the bowl; it was automated, and would only require occasional check-ins. As they wrapped up repairs, the team received a communication from **Patience**: the leaders of **Merricktown** and **Liu Maize**, unlicensed settlements near **Evergreen** but not part of it themselves, required assistance with a problem of their own...

# Home on the Range

**Patience** explained the situation. Suffering attacks of their own, **Merricktown** and **Liu Maize** had begun a buildup of force lately after entering into a mutual defense pact. After the recent attacks, a great deal of independents had been forced to take shelter in these towns, bringing unnerving tales and stories with them. Now, the settlements had requested **Evergreen's** formal aid in repelling the raiders, sending out a call for military help and providing a blurry image of an unfamiliar type of mech spotted in the area.

During further analysis of the situation, **Patience** had discovered oddities in the raids that didn't make sense; senseless damage, bodies of workers being torn apart, and food stores being left untouched. At the same time, drones and subalterns from the towns had begun acting haywire - not responding to commands, behaving erratically, and marching deep into the jungle to the east.

These factors, taken together, drove **Patience** to conclude that it may be a different perpetrator entirely. As a result, they responded to the settlements' requests for help by contacting **Seral-19** and asking them to investigate the threat and discover if it might pose a security risk to **Evergreen.**

The group's new destination was a farmhouse belonging to a family named the **Châus**, about 140 kilometers from **Evergreen.** As they traveled, they came across rogue subalterns, milling about in flooded fields - like reports had suggested - heading east, as well as receiving a radio communication from **Albert Châu**, one of the farmers, informing the squad that he and his family were trapped inside the house. When they reached the farmhouse, they witnessed a disturbing sight: hundreds of subalterns and drones, perfectly still or walking in circles, outside the farmhouse, which had been boarded up. At its center was the unfamiliar mech, looking ancient and covered in signal-boosting machinery.

When the group sent a ping to the mech to try and get a response, they received what appeared to be a surrender and evacuation order written in ancient Union Navy milscript, reserved for generals in the SecComm era, and terminating with:

**YOU ARE SAFE. UNION IS HERE**

# The Horde

As the group approached, the robots turned aggressive, engaging the squad in combat. The central mech (subsequently discovered to be designated simply as **BROADCAST** in its internal hardware ) itself appeared to be controlling the rest - including literally raising their wrecks from the dead after they fell - and once it was finally brought down, the remainder of the subalterns dispersed, shutting down on the spot or heading east.

**Albert Châu** emerged from the farmhouse after confirming it was safe, immensely relieved at the squad's timely intervention. He explained that he had heard what was happening to the other farms, but that nothing had happened to theirs... until now. In the hours leading up to the incident, the farm's comp/con had begun acting strangely, and he suggested taking a look at it. For their part, the **Châus** living in the farmhouse - **Albert**, **Nora**, and their kids - no longer felt safe staying there, and had hurriedly packed their belongings in order to stay with the family matriarchs, **Maggi** and **Weiyi**, at their own ranch.

**Southwest** investigated the comp/con, and discovered that it had been morphed into something bizarre. Its interface had been replaced with a read-only one, repeating a message on loop (the same one that the squad had received from **[THE BROADCAST]**). All of the other uses had been deleted, and replaced with a single root-level user executing the commands: **BEGGAR_ONE**. Digging deeper into the signal, they discovered some more information about its nature: it was a reactivation signal, and appeared to be shepherding the infected machines to some point to the east. **[THE BROADCAST]** had been acting as an amplifier, but even in its absence, the signal appeared to be washing over the entire valley.

Finally, **Southwest** discovered that part of the codebase could be partitioned into a self-contained package, and did so at the request of **Tzadek.** Afterwards, the comp/con burned out from the stress, leaving a slagged heap of remains.

**Seral-19** returned to **Evergreen,** bringing the burnt-out hardware of the **Châus'** comp/con with them. During the return trip, **Tzadek** began acting strangely, behaving in ways not unlike the compromised machines. In the end, they were able to retain control of their faculties during the trip back, during which the group escorted the **Châus** out of the danger zone and towards their new home.

# Downtime

**Patience** debriefed the group The militia had succeeded in locating and driving off the sniper, at the cost of some casualties. The situation had calmed down, if not become truly stable. **Patience** concluded the group's first mission by instructing them to maintain a state of readiness over the coming days and weeks.

**Tzadek** would come to the conclusion that whatever was affecting the machines was also affecting them. They had begun noticing a strange ordering to the world - trees bending in the same direction, people marching in sync for too long - and although their diagnostics came back green, something was there, and something had to be done.

In exchange for their help, **Castor Fielding** rewarded each member of the group with a core battery as reserves for the next mission.
