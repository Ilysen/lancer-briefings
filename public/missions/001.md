# Mission // #001
## Phosphorous Smoke

The *Burn Rubber* will depart from Cerro Solitaria at 0239 hours, and will proceed to Magus at 0.866 c (to avoid unnecessary time dilation). Travel time is approx. three hours, and the hold is loaded with yourselves and everything you need for the trip.

Hired guns prowl the access corridor between the station and Magus. Your job is to keep the ship from being waylaid on the way, and help secure the landing site from aggressive fauna.

# Goals
- Bring the *Burn Rubber* and all of its supplies to Magus.
- Establish a FOB clear of insects.
- Keep August safe and alive.

# Stakes
- If the *Burn Rubber* goes down, you go down with it. Loss of the prefab kits means a return to base, which will take precious time.

# Reserves
- None at this time.
