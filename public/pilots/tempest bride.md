Here's a selection of things you may know about Anthem Himalaya:

**Her name may (at your discretion) remind you of the following:**
It's the name of the lead actress from an obscure but long-running omninet show that, though she's probably not the same person - maybe she took the name for herself, or maybe it was given by her parents?

**Her appearance, which you might have seen any number of ways:**
She's tall and slender, with dark skin, intensely green eyes, purple hair, and a serene but inscrutable expression. Outside of combat situations, she wears relatively neutral civilian clothing and has her hair down. In combat situations, however, she wears a bright red light mobility suit with a high 'collar' and keeps her hair pinned up out of the way.

**If you met her in person, or over an omninet call:**
She was polite, pleasant, and seemed as serene as her appearance suggested - which is a bit unusual for a relatively new Lancer pilot, especially one likely to drop into a situation as dangerous as this one. You also don't feel like you got much information out of her, though how much you realize that is up to you.
