# Future Perfect
The Expedition conducted its third downtime over the course of about a month and a half, starting with the group introducing themselves at Cornucopia and registering themselves as guests there:
* Macross used the orbital platform to conduct a thorough sweep, and at last made visual confirmation of a camouflaged corvette - almost certainly belonging to the SSC - searching the Crucible Region.
* Tempest Bride tried to slip into Cornucopia discreetly, but was caught by the senior hydroponicist, who kindly directed her to the main entrance. Afterwards, she put the *Lotus Prince* to work in clearing a nest of giant wasps that had been terrorizing the colony's farm workers.
* Duck got in touch with an old company friend, who confirmed that his former employer didn't seem to be in the process of tracking him down. Later, he attempted to use *Ballbreaker* as a makeshift plow, with mixed success.

While in Cornucopia, a pilot presented themselves and requested work. After a brief interview, **Moonshine** was accepted into the expedition's ranks.

# Gold Rush
The group's fifth venture began with a simple goal: track down whatever remained of SecComm's research labs. They quickly received a legal threat from the Smith-Shimano Corpro demanding that they stop and surrender their assets, which they promptly ignored.

After some largely fruitless searching, the squad was confronted by an SSC team and its field commander - Desi Lamar - who reiterated the corpro's demand that the expedition give up its assets and cease its searching.

When the group refused to cave, Lamar ordered their troops to attack, and a brief scuffle ensued before being crashed by a patrol of Caspar Bugs. The Constellars retreated, but Desi made it clear that they'd be back.

# Come One, Come All

The Expedition continued its search by getting an up-to-date picture of the surface, using mapping drones shot from orbit. They didn't find anything, but they did clear a significant amount of territory.

On the way back, the group picked up a distress call from an SSC mech. They investigated, found a lightly-armed scout trapped under a rockfall and in need of assistance.

The group rescued the pilot from entrapment. His callsign was Sushi, and his frame was the *Incredible Strongman.* He explained that he had been ambushed by Caspar bugs, and to return the favor of his rescue, he misled his superiors about the party's location before scampering off (with their permission.)

# The Kind and Benevolent King

Winding down from searching in the next few days, August picked up a massive Caspar lifeform headed straight from the Expedition, seemingly with the goal of setting up a hive. The squad scrambled a response and met the bugs head-on, and the towering Caspar Viceroy was brought down just before it could reach the clearing.

In the coming days, it would become clear that this particular hive, no longer willing to suffer additional losses, had shifted its focus away from the Expedition, and begun new attacks on Cornucopia and the SSC expeditionaries instead.
